What the project does: 
The purpose of this application is to allow bars/restaurants/caterers to keep an inventory of the amount of wine and beer they have on hand. Bartenders will be able to log individual drinks sold while Glass Track logs how much new inventory needs to be ordered. For example if four glasses are sold, Glass Track will log that as one new wine bottle needed in the inventory.

Why the project is useful:
This project is useful because it will help the service industry avoid waste, while remaining fully stocked on their beverage inventory. Glass Track marks discrepancies the amount of drinks served and the amount of bottles used per night. This is done by comparing a computed inventory to a physical inventory that is inputted by a manager user. For example, if a bartender logs 2 glasses of wine sold, but there is an entire bottle missing, Glass Track can inform the managerâ€™s account on that discrepancy. This helps to keep bartending staff honest, and prevents over-pouring. 

How users can get started with the project:
Users can get started through our login/signup page after belonging to an organization that is already using Glass Track. Organizations can personalize the amount per drink that is equivalent to their inventory per bottle. Once their Glass Track profile is created, bartenders and managers will be able to access all the features designated to their position.
